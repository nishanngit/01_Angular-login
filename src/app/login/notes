NOTES

DATA BINDING   - sharing data inside a component

1. One Way Binding 
  html -> ts  OR ts -> html  -- can share data. 

  ts -> file is called component
  html -> file is called view

  1.1  Component to View (TS file to HTML file)
        a. String Interpolation  - {{expression}}
        b. Property Binding [attribute name]="Property"
  1.2  view to component (html -> TS)
        a. Event Binding - (event name)="function name()"   
        b. Event Binding using $(event) - (event name) ="function name($event)"
        c. Event Binding using template referencing variable -  #variable name 

2. Two Way Binding
